					<h3>How to use.</h3>
					<h4>Start Page.</h4>
					<p>Overview of Main page is shown on image below:<br>
					<img src="Component0.jpg" class="img-rounded"></br>
					
					<p>The start page shows a table with statictic for last builds for every component with last start date, total amount of testcases, failed testcases, success ratio in percent and execution time.
					In the bottom of the page is shown a chart with success rate per Component in last 30 days.</p>
					
					<p>In the column named "Component" are laced ASF Components. Click on it to get the page with detaled report.<br>
					<img src="Component1.jpg" class="img-rounded"><br>
					In the column named "Last Build Name" is placed last tested build of current ASF Component. Click on it to get the page with detaled report of this build.<br>
					<img src="Component2.jpg" class="img-rounded"><br></p>
					
					<h4>Detailed Report.</h4>
					<p>Overview of Detailed report is shown on image below:<br>
					<img src="Component3.jpg" class="img-rounded"><br>
					On this page you can select a Component, Date range, build name and delete the result of testing build. 
					</p>
					
					<p>When you select a Build you will get the build error report. See image below:<br>
					<img src="Component4.jpg" class="img-rounded"><br>
					On error report page you can find a statuses of testcases.
					</p>
					<p>If error is present - you can click "View Log" button to see what failured.<br>

					</p>
					
					<p>When you press a button with cone icon near the build name, you will exit from error report:<br>

					<h3>How it works.</h3>
					Every 15 minutes <abbr title="Alstom Build Framework">Dispatcher</abbr> check for a new build. If any build is present, Dispatcher starts a new test process.
					The test process contains steps to deploy last build, recreate database for this build and configure a security options for builds. Before deployment, Dispatcher 
					updates environment with last build of EMP. After all deployment steps, Dispatcher fetch from TFS all test projects and testrun script.
					<h3>The process of testruns.</h3>
					The testsrun script make a some checks:
					<ul>
					<li>Check check if JBoss is alive</li>
					<li>Check buildname of deployed component and compare it version in the db</li>
					<li>Check check if build is accessible via http.</li>
					</ul>
					If everething is OK - SoupUI is started.
					After testing, script parses a <code>report.xml</code> and puts data to the database.
					
					The ASF Testing - CI Reports provide a view of statistics of CI in time, shows improvment of ASF Component in chart and useful for builds analysis.
